## Goal description


## What is ORKG?
"The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) project works on answers and solutions to the next generation of digital libraries so that scholarly publications are semantically
connected to each other and to other research objects. ORKG focuses on the publication content, e.g., research problem, hypothesis or related data, making it easier to compare
publications based on the facts they contain and discuss. It offers multiple views including data tables and graphs. Researchers can directly add their articles and start
describing their content and connect them to others. ORKG aims to describe research papers in a structured manner. With the ORKG, papers are easier to find and compare."
